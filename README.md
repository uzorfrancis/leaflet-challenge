# leaflet-challenge
This is a challenge on using the data from The United States Geological Survey, or USGS.
The following steps was taken in creating the files:
Create the Earthquake Visualization
The firts part uses HMTL,CSS and JavaScript code for visualization

Leaflet was used to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
